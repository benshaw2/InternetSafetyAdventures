    <h1>Gotcha!</h1>
    <p>You clicked a link that did not take you to the movie. That can happen on real sites too—sometimes by mistake, or because someone is trying to trick you.</p>

    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Watch" button was programmed to redirect to this page so we could show how it feels when a link doesn't do what you expect.</li>
      <li>Websites in real life can look safe and fun, but then take you to harmful sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips to stay safe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Always check the website name: are you on the site you expect?</li>
      <li>If a page looks strange or asks for extra info, ask a grown-up before continuing. (Can you see anything strange about the "streaming" site?)</li>
      <li>Hover over links (or long-press on mobile) to see where they go. If you're not sure, don’t click!</li>
      <li>Use parental controls and talk openly about what sites are allowed.</li>
    </ol>
