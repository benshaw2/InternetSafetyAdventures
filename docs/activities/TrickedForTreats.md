# Online Trick-or-Treat — An InternetSafetyAdventures Activity

Online Trick-or-Treat is a self-contained interactive simulation that teaches children about the risks of sharing personal information online.

It is part of the InternetSafetyAdventures project — a collection of playful, educational activities demonstrating how to stay safe on the internet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this activity, children take part in a virtual "trick-or-treat" game. 
They earn candy by answering fun questions while competing on a visible leaderboard. 
As the game progresses, the questions become more personal — gradually asking for details such as names, birthdays, or addresses.

If the player provides such information, they appear higher on the leaderboard and eventually “win” — only to discover that sharing personal information online can be unsafe.

The experience ends with a clear, age-appropriate explanation of why it’s important not to share private details with websites or strangers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Learning Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This activity helps children:
- Recognize the difference between harmless and private information.
- Understand that “winning” online isn’t worth revealing personal details.
- Build healthy skepticism toward websites that ask for information.
- Reflect on privacy and digital responsibility in a safe, guided context.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## How to Play
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Launch the activity by opening `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose a Halloween costume avatar.
3. Visit virtual “houses” and answer questions to collect candy.
4. Watch your ranking change on the leaderboard.
5. Try quitting early or finishing the game — different outcomes illustrate the consequences of data sharing.

All interactions run locally in the browser. No personal data is stored or transmitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Educational Flow
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **index.html** – Introduction and avatar selection.
2. **game.html** – Main gameplay with leaderboard and question progression.
3. **address.html** – “Prize claim” page where players are prompted to share their address.
4. **redirect.html** – “Gotcha” page revealing the privacy lesson.
5. **takeaway.html** – Reflection and key takeaways for students.

Each page reinforces the educational theme while maintaining a fun, child-safe presentation.
