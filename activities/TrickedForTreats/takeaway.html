    <h1>🧠 What We Learned</h1>

    <section class="lesson-summary">
      <p>
        In this activity, you played a fun game of “Online Trick-or-Treat.”  
        The game asked you for more and more personal information — like your name, birthday, or even your address — to “win” candy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you entered your address, the game said your candy was on its way — but then you found out it wasn’t safe to share that kind of information!
      </p>

    <section class="key-points">
      <h2>🚫 Think Before You Share</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Never share your <strong>real name</strong>, <strong>address</strong>, or <strong>birthdate</strong> online without checking with an adult.</li>
        <li>Even if a game or website looks fun or friendly, it might not be safe to give out personal details.</li>
        <li>Always ask a <strong>parent, teacher, or trusted adult</strong> before filling in forms online.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💡 Fun Fact</h2>
      <p>Websites sometimes ask for information that’s used to guess passwords or find where you live — that’s why we keep it private!</p>
