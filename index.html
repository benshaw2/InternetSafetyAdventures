      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>InternetSafetyAdventures</strong> is an open educational project that helps
        children and families learn about internet safety through interactive web simulations.
        Each activity mimics a familiar online scenario, revealing how to recognize safe versus unsafe digital behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed for classrooms, parents, and independent learners, these activities are fully
        self-contained — no installation, servers, or data collection required. Everything runs directly in the browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Educational Intent</h2>
      <p>
        The project was created to make digital safety education engaging and experiential.
        Each simulation provides a safe space for children to make small, guided mistakes
        and then reflect on what happened. This promotes lasting understanding rather than rote memorization.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourage critical thinking online.</li>
        <li>Teach awareness of deceptive design and phishing tactics.</li>
        <li>Promote discussion between teachers, parents, and students.</li>
      </ul>

              A simulation of a fake streaming site. Children click what appears to be a
              normal “Watch” button, but are redirected to a teaching page explaining how
              misleading links can appear trustworthy and how to check URLs safely.
