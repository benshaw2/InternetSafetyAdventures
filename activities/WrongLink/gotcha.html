    <h1>Gotcha — this was a simulation</h1>
    <p>You clicked a link that did not take you to the movie. That can happen on real sites too — sometimes by mistake, or because someone is trying to trick you.</p>

    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Watch" button was programmed to redirect to this page so we could show how it feels when a link doesn't do what you expect.</li>
      <li>Notice whether the link asked for anything (it didn’t) — never enter passwords or personal info on pages you weren’t expecting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips to stay safe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Always check the website name — are you on the site you expect?</li>
      <li>If a page looks strange or asks for extra info, ask a grown-up before continuing.</li>
      <li>Hover over links (or long-press on mobile) to see where they go — if unsure, don’t click.</li>
      <li>Use parental controls and talk openly about what sites are allowed.</li>
    </ol>

    <button onclick="location.href='index.html'">Try again</button>

      if (h1) h1.textContent = `Gotcha — ${decodeURIComponent(title)}`;
